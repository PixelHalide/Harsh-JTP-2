# format string 0

We start off with a large C file.

I look at the block of code that runs when we run the file:

```

void serve_patrick() {
    printf("%s %s\n%s\n%s %s\n%s",
            "Welcome to our newly-opened burger place Pico 'n Patty!",
            "Can you help the picky customers find their favorite burger?",
            "Here comes the first customer Patrick who wants a giant bite.",
            "Please choose from the following burgers:",
            "Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe",
            "Enter your recommendation: ");
    fflush(stdout);

    char choice1[BUFSIZE];
    scanf("%s", choice1);
    char *menu1[3] = {"Breakf@st_Burger", "Gr%114d_Cheese", "Bac0n_D3luxe"};
    if (!on_menu(choice1, menu1, 3)) {
        printf("%s", "There is no such burger yet!\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    } else {
        int count = printf(choice1);
        if (count > 2 * BUFSIZE) {
            serve_bob();
        } else {
            printf("%s\n%s\n",
                    "Patrick is still hungry!",
                    "Try to serve him something of larger size!");
            fflush(stdout);
        }
    }
}
```
I look closely at the code, and realise the weird %s and %d dotted everywhere. I enter in a large string to see if something breaks, but nothing happens. I see the **%114d** in Gr%114d_Cheese, which pads any input to 114 digits, and I simply just try to input a 115 digit number to see what happens. Lo and Behold, It prints out the flag **picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_ef312157}**.
