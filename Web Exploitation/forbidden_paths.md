# Forbidden Paths

We are greeted with a website with a text entry field and the name of some files, along with ..

putting the file name in the text box outputs the file content for us. i input .. to try and see if the website goes into the previous directory, and it does. But the directory seems to be empty, and we cannot do anything after opening a file.

we are given the information that the website's working directory is **/usr/share/nginx/html/**, and the flag is in the root directory as flag.txt

the entry box filters out all absolute paths and works with relative paths, which is why we are able to open files with just inputting their name. i try to run some commands in the entry field like cd and echo to see if it acts like a linux terminal, but it does not. 

we must reach the home directory using relative paths, and we can do this with **..**, which goes up to the parent directory.

I input **../../../flag.txt** into the text field, and this yields us the flag. This command goes up 3 directores, html -> nginx -> share -> usr -> /, and then runs flag.txt.
